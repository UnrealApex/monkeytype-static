    "body": "The Rewrite Update. It might not have many new awesome features, but I completely rewrote all of the scripts, dividing them nicely into modules. This creates a solid foundation to continue work on Tribe. If you ever thought about contributing to the project, but were scared away by the file structure - it should be easier to understand the project layout now. Now to merge this over to the Tribe branch, and its smooth sailing from now on.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Word filter. With this new feature, you are able to filter any language list of your choosing. You can include or exclude words, bigrams or characters, and further filter the words by length. You can find it in the custom text popup window. Thanks Smithster.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added loads of quotes suggested by the Discord server members.\r\n- Added Portuguese quotes. Thanks pserey.\r\n- Added more Polish quotes. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed Russian quotes using incorrect space character.\r\n- Moved a comma in a German quote.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Spanish 10k. Thanks iuuang.\r\n- Removed some words from Danish.\r\n- Added Polish 200k. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Updated the Filipino 1k list. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Grand Prix theme. Thanks zekth.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed custom fonts not applying and sometimes breaking config loading and saving. Thanks leduyquang753. \r\n- Fixed line pace caret being too low.\r\n- Fixed change qutoe length > all command not working. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed a bug where new line characters after 100th word would not display/work correctly.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Smoothed out the transition between test config and sign out button when changing pages.\r\n- Changed the icon of the quote search to a search icon instead of a tools icon.\r\n- Limited the quote source width so that it doesn't take up loads of space on the result screen.\r\n- Added the ability to copy words to clipboard from the command line. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Improved custom test duration input parsing. You can now input strings like '1h', '1m + 10s' and so on, and it will automatically be converted to seconds and applied. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Rewrote the whole website, moving away from huge files in favour of small, focused modules."

All you quote fanatics can now expand our quote database by submitting your own in the #quote-submission Discord channel. This change means that you have to specify what language you want to type in, when choosing quote mode.\r\n- Redesigned the notifications. They will now appear in top right corner, and will be colored to quickly tell the user what has happened and if it requires their attention. Errors will remain on the screen, and all notifications can be dismissed by clicking them.\r\n- Expanded custom texts. You can now start timed custom tests, and both timed and words custom tests support infinite tests by inputting the number 0 into the number field. Customs tests can also use punctuation and numbers. You will also finally be able to test your speed in code, with proper support for enters and tabs. New lines will appear as a faint, down arrow while tabs will appear as a long, right arrow.\r\n- Tag pbs 2.0! This one is for all of you who use tags on a daily basis, and really wanted more details on your personal bests with them. Now, tag pbs work the same way as normal pbs, and they are unique to each mode. Tag pbs will also alternate sides on the graph, to avoid overlap.\r\n- Discord Rich Presence. Thanks to PreMiD, you can now show all your friends that you're playing Monkeytype. Rich presence will include what page you're viewing, what test you're completing or completed including your wpm and accuracy. It can be enabled by installing the PreMiD extension and desktop app and searching for Monkeytype in their Presence Store. https://premid.app/\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Stealth. Thanks ryevertigo.\r\n- Fixed missing error extra color for Carbon theme. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added some more quotes.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Code_Javascript_1k. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n- Removed some non-Swedish words from the Swedish list.\r\n- Added Polish_2k. Thanks jacekdobrowolski.\r\n- Added Malay. Thanks krsntn.\r\n- Added Czech_10k. Thanks Inirdin.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where punctuation and numbers settings would reset after practising missed words. Thanks SeerLite.\r\n- Fixed broken discord integration link.\r\n- Fixed enter affecting the test even when not focused on the words.\r\n- Fixed quick tab not working on the result screen.\r\n- Fixed a bug where media keys would insert text into the test.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Renamed list files for easier project navigation.\r\n- Live accuracy will now update on keypress rather than every second.\r\n- Added more server side data validation.\r\n- Made some errors more descriptive."

Very helpful to keep the progression trend upwards, without pushing yourself for your pb too much. Thanks Jonny-exe!\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where Portuguese tests could not be started.\r\n- Fixed 'swapEscAndTab' sometimes not working as intended. Thanks SeerLite.\r\n- Fixed a graphical bug where the live wpm and accuracy would be visible for a split second when refreshing the page.\r\n- Updated the regular expressions while checking the completed test to avoid issued with tests not saving.\r\n- Fixed a bug where typing some special characters in the command line would result in an error.\r\n- Updated the screenshot library to fix a bug where custom fonts would not be visible. Thanks TayIorRobinson.\r\n- Hopefully fixed a bug where account page could not be loaded due to stats not defaulting to 0. Needs a bit more testing from the users.\r\n- Fixed a bug where code languages with punctuation enabled would not initialise properly.\r\n- Fixed an error when trying to reset config to default.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Twitch Emotes. Thanks MakerJake01.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Backend optimisations.\r\n- You can now use Vi-like bindings in the command line (Alt+J and Alt+K)."

Same idea as the previous one, but this time only hiding one future word.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Sonokai. Thanks Provola23.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Improved the Code Python word list. Thanks lucas-fern.\r\n- Greatly improved the Portuguese word list. Thanks OldMope.\r\n- Added Code Go. Thanks beckxie.\r\n- Fixed small typo in Code Java.

No more selecting the wrong option if your mouse is hovering over the command line!\r\n- Fixed a bug where the 'word joiner' special character was not stripped from custom text and causing issues when typing.\r\n- Fixed a bug where you could start typing during a page transition, resulting in an infinite test.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the filters would constantly reset to default.\r\n- Fixed a bug where Indonesian tests could not be started. Thanks aviegdown\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Allowing keyboard events where alt and ctrl is pressed together. Helpful for layouts where some special characters are locked behind this combination.\r\n- Brought back infinite wpm (its not a bug, its a feature).\r\n- Improved the capitalization and punctuation of code languages with punctuation mode enabled. Thanks lucas-fern.\r\n- Removed arrows inside every input field in Firefox. Thanks Jonny-exe.\r\n- Refactoring front end code. Thanks Provola23.\r\n- Refactored and optimised back end code."
