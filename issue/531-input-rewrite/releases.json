    "body": "We haven't had a minor number bump and since this one is quite large I thought why not. Mongo rewrite is going well, I'm starting to work on it much more now. This are starting to speed up again!\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Added Weakspot funbox. With this funbox, you will be able to train letters that you type slow or mistype by altering the word generation based on your previous tests. This is just the initial version and will be updated with time, as we are not sure if the words are changed too much or not enough. Thanks shishberg.\r\n- Added burst heatmap to the result screen. You can find the button next to the 'Copy words list' button. This will highlight words in different colors based on their burst speed (which, to remind you, is measured in raw wpm from the first keypress to last keypress - so excluding time between words).\r\n- Added Today Tracker. This will display how much time you've spent typing, on the result screen, below the test time. If you have not downloaded your user results yet, it will show the current session typing time. However, if you have visited the account screen at least once, it will sum all the time typing from the current day.\r\n- Language-specific punctuation. Punctuation mode will now take into consideration the currently selected language and change accordingly. Currently the affected languages so far are French, Spanish, Russian, Spanish, Catalan, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Greek, Ukrainian and Code. If your language is missing, or the custom punctuation is incorrect, let me know.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Fixed typos.\r\n- Added loads of German quotes. Thanks Meimersdorfer.\r\n- Added Dutch quotes. Thanks polygonalenippel.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added VSCode. Thanks Odyssey346.\r\n\r\nLayouts:\r\n- Added Semimak.\r\n- Added Boo. Thanks Apsu.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added English 5k.\r\n- Updated Javascript. Thanks HachemiH.\r\n- Added Welsh.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed zen mode not working correctly with burst calculation.\r\n- Fixed ctrl + backspace not working correctly with punctuation and some languages.\r\n- Fixed stop on word replay error. Thanks lukew3.\r\n- Fixed repeated pace caret being stuck.\r\n- Fixed jumpy animation when 'always show words history' is enabled.\r\n- Fixed a bug where you could type while the leaderboards were open.\r\n- Fixed a bug where min burst had no default config value.\r\n- Fixed a bug where key tips could not be toggled from the command line.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Presets will now remember active tags.\r\n- Reworked the command line. Each option now has an icon, to visually represent a setting. There are also checkmark icons to represent which setting is active. No more toggle settings where you don't know if the setting is active or not!\r\n- Updated the look of custom text popup on very small displays. Thanks DrPoppyseed.\r\n- Pace caret will no longer jump forward when stop on word is enabled.\r\n- Brought back the button to clear tag pb.\r\n- Purged as many bad words from lists and quotes as I could find.\r\n- Updating email does not require the current email anymore. However, it does require that you type the new email twice.\r\n- Clearing personal bests now requires your password.\r\n- Added username to the built-in screenshot.",

    "body": "New features:\r\n- Added min burst. This setting works similarly to min wpm and min accuracy where the test will fail if you fail to meet the criteria. Burst is how fast you type a single word from the first keystroke to the last. This means that burst is measured in raw wpm and does not include the pause between words. You can pick between fixed mode and flex mode. With flex mode, longer words automatically lower the threshold a bit.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Ukrainian with 1k, 10k and 50k options.\r\n- Updated Urdu and added Urdu 1k. Thanks BalkoBalkho.\r\n- Updated Czech 10k. Thanks CrumblyLiquid.\r\n- Added Pinyin. Thanks KobeCofini.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added 82 French quotes. Thanks precondition.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Ez Mode. Thanks kraiztmatte.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where words added in random custom mode would not be randomized.\r\n- Fixed a bug that would cause Firefox to not load the first page.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the caret would sometimes move up when moving to the next word.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the opposite shift would get stuck in a state of 'both shifts pressed' and would result in the user not being able to type on one half of the keyboard.\r\n- Fixed failed tests having unwanted afk time.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Funboxes plus one and plus two will contribute towards your personal best (since it doesn't affect word generation or speed calculation and some users have those funboxes are good for accessibility).\r\n- Removed some leftover console logs.\r\n- When hide extra letters is enabled, an error underline will be shown under the word if the input length is greater than the word length.\r\n- Updated the tags section design on the settings page to match the design of the presets section.\r\n- Removed the underscore from the language name when displayed on the result screen.\r\n- Added fail reason to the result screen.\r\n- Updated the design of the min wpm, min acc, and pace caret settings sections.\r\n- You can now view the burst speed of any word on the result screen by hovering over that word in the result history.",

This loading page will remain until the account data is fully loaded (or in the case where you are not logged in, when the website is loaded). This is done to hopefully prevent some issues that would show up while the user was typing and the website was loading in the background. I'll monitor the impact of this change. Remember to share any thoughts you might have too.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Urdu. Thanks BalkoBalkho.\r\n- Updated Filipino words. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n- Fixed Lithuanian typos. Thanks Brachyurus.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Fixed typos. Thanks lukew3, drambique\r\n- Added more quotes.

Thanks, Maclogger.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added more Java quotes. Thanks mtthwn.\r\n\r\nBug fixes: \r\n- Avoiding the website refreshing on login multiple times by saving newly applied config to the database to ensure new keys are set to their default values.\r\n- Fixed a bug where long values for custom layoutfluid would cause the config to fail while saving.\r\n- Fixed a bug where input HTML would be evaluated when hovering over words on the result page.\r\n- Fixed result words history not working properly with right to left languages or languages with ligatures.\r\n- Fixed a bug where seconds with decimal places would be added to the graph in time mode, which showed up as a dip in raw wpm just at the end of a test.\r\n- Fixed a bug where all tags would appear as active on the settings page. Thanks, Estebene.\r\n- Fixed indicate typos not working with word highlight mode.\r\n- Fixed a bug where clicking practise missed words multiple times in a row would reset the settings to their state before practising.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Removed auto-select from the custom layoutfluid field.\r\n- The amount of words when practising missed words is now dependent on how many words you've missed. Currently, it is around 5 per word (but it's also still weighted meaning words you missed more will appear more often). This amount could be updated if you guys feel like it's not enough.\r\n- Moved the layoutfluid command in the command line.\r\n- Words will no longer jump up slightly after finishing a test.\r\n- Restarting the test when applying a settings preset.\r\n- Added Bigram Salad and I Can See The Future to the list of supported 'quick setup' challenges.\r\n- Changing highlight mode will now cause the current word to update to reflect the change.\r\n- Added a timer to the replay. Thanks, lukew3.\r\n"

You now have the ability to use any image (as long as it's uploaded to a hosting site for example Discord, Imgur, and so on) as your custom Monkeytype background. You can set its size and even apply filters like blur, opacity, saturation, and brightness. Big thanks to Sam the Smithster.\r\n\r\nTheme:\r\n- Added Muted. Thanks 71xn.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Removed some incorrect words from Czech. Thanks CrumblyLiquid.\r\n- Removed duplicates from Czech 1k.

Makes the caret seem more responsive.\r\n- Database config sync is back. If your account config is different to your local config, and you didn't start a test or touch any settings it will be automatically applied.\r\n- Quick tab will not restart the test if the command line is active.

Now to merge this over to the Tribe branch, and its smooth sailing from now on.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Word filter. With this new feature, you are able to filter any language list of your choosing. You can include or exclude words, bigrams or characters, and further filter the words by length. You can find it in the custom text popup window. Thanks Smithster.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added loads of quotes suggested by the Discord server members.\r\n- Added Portuguese quotes. Thanks pserey.\r\n- Added more Polish quotes. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed Russian quotes using incorrect space character.\r\n- Moved a comma in a German quote.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Spanish 10k. Thanks iuuang.\r\n- Removed some words from Danish.\r\n- Added Polish 200k. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Updated the Filipino 1k list. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Grand Prix theme.

Thanks leduyquang753. \r\n- Fixed line pace caret being too low.\r\n- Fixed change qutoe length > all command not working. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed a bug where new line characters after 100th word would not display/work correctly.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Smoothed out the transition between test config and sign out button when changing pages.\r\n- Changed the icon of the quote search to a search icon instead of a tools icon.\r\n- Limited the quote source width so that it doesn't take up loads of space on the result screen.\r\n- Added the ability to copy words to clipboard from the command line. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Improved custom test duration input parsing. You can now input strings like '1h', '1m + 10s' and so on, and it will automatically be converted to seconds and applied. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Rewrote the whole website, moving away from huge files in favour of small, focused modules."

    "body": "New features:\r\n- Quote multi language support and quote submission. All you quote fanatics can now expand our quote database by submitting your own in the #quote-submission Discord channel. This change means that you have to specify what language you want to type in, when choosing quote mode.\r\n- Redesigned the notifications. They will now appear in top right corner, and will be colored to quickly tell the user what has happened and if it requires their attention. Errors will remain on the screen, and all notifications can be dismissed by clicking them.\r\n- Expanded custom texts. You can now start timed custom tests, and both timed and words custom tests support infinite tests by inputting the number 0 into the number field. Customs tests can also use punctuation and numbers. You will also finally be able to test your speed in code, with proper support for enters and tabs. New lines will appear as a faint, down arrow while tabs will appear as a long, right arrow.\r\n- Tag pbs 2.0! This one is for all of you who use tags on a daily basis, and really wanted more details on your personal bests with them. Now, tag pbs work the same way as normal pbs, and they are unique to each mode. Tag pbs will also alternate sides on the graph, to avoid overlap.\r\n- Discord Rich Presence. Thanks to PreMiD, you can now show all your friends that you're playing Monkeytype. Rich presence will include what page you're viewing, what test you're completing or completed including your wpm and accuracy. It can be enabled by installing the PreMiD extension and desktop app and searching for Monkeytype in their Presence Store. https://premid.app/\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Stealth. Thanks ryevertigo.\r\n- Fixed missing error extra color for Carbon theme. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added some more quotes.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Code_Javascript_1k. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n- Removed some non-Swedish words from the Swedish list.\r\n- Added Polish_2k. Thanks jacekdobrowolski.\r\n- Added Malay. Thanks krsntn.\r\n- Added Czech_10k. Thanks Inirdin.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where punctuation and numbers settings would reset after practising missed words. Thanks SeerLite.\r\n- Fixed broken discord integration link.\r\n- Fixed enter affecting the test even when not focused on the words.\r\n- Fixed quick tab not working on the result screen.\r\n- Fixed a bug where media keys would insert text into the test.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Renamed list files for easier project navigation.\r\n- Live accuracy will now update on keypress rather than every second.\r\n- Added more server side data validation.\r\n- Made some errors more descriptive."
