    "body": "The Rewrite Update. It might not have many new awesome features, but I completely rewrote all of the scripts, dividing them nicely into modules. This creates a solid foundation to continue work on Tribe. If you ever thought about contributing to the project, but were scared away by the file structure - it should be easier to understand the project layout now. Now to merge this over to the Tribe branch, and its smooth sailing from now on.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Word filter. With this new feature, you are able to filter any language list of your choosing. You can include or exclude words, bigrams or characters, and further filter the words by length. You can find it in the custom text popup window. Thanks Smithster.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added loads of quotes suggested by the Discord server members.\r\n- Added Portuguese quotes. Thanks pserey.\r\n- Added more Polish quotes. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed Russian quotes using incorrect space character.\r\n- Moved a comma in a German quote.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Spanish 10k. Thanks iuuang.\r\n- Removed some words from Danish.\r\n- Added Polish 200k. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Updated the Filipino 1k list. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Grand Prix theme. Thanks zekth.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed custom fonts not applying and sometimes breaking config loading and saving. Thanks leduyquang753. \r\n- Fixed line pace caret being too low.\r\n- Fixed change qutoe length > all command not working. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed a bug where new line characters after 100th word would not display/work correctly.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Smoothed out the transition between test config and sign out button when changing pages.\r\n- Changed the icon of the quote search to a search icon instead of a tools icon.\r\n- Limited the quote source width so that it doesn't take up loads of space on the result screen.\r\n- Added the ability to copy words to clipboard from the command line. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Improved custom test duration input parsing. You can now input strings like '1h', '1m + 10s' and so on, and it will automatically be converted to seconds and applied. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Rewrote the whole website, moving away from huge files in favour of small, focused modules."

All you quote fanatics can now expand our quote database by submitting your own in the #quote-submission Discord channel. This change means that you have to specify what language you want to type in, when choosing quote mode.\r\n- Redesigned the notifications. They will now appear in top right corner, and will be colored to quickly tell the user what has happened and if it requires their attention. Errors will remain on the screen, and all notifications can be dismissed by clicking them.\r\n- Expanded custom texts. You can now start timed custom tests, and both timed and words custom tests support infinite tests by inputting the number 0 into the number field. Customs tests can also use punctuation and numbers. You will also finally be able to test your speed in code, with proper support for enters and tabs. New lines will appear as a faint, down arrow while tabs will appear as a long, right arrow.\r\n- Tag pbs 2.0! This one is for all of you who use tags on a daily basis, and really wanted more details on your personal bests with them. Now, tag pbs work the same way as normal pbs, and they are unique to each mode. Tag pbs will also alternate sides on the graph, to avoid overlap.\r\n- Discord Rich Presence. Thanks to PreMiD, you can now show all your friends that you're playing Monkeytype. Rich presence will include what page you're viewing, what test you're completing or completed including your wpm and accuracy. It can be enabled by installing the PreMiD extension and desktop app and searching for Monkeytype in their Presence Store. https://premid.app/\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Stealth. Thanks ryevertigo.\r\n- Fixed missing error extra color for Carbon theme. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added some more quotes.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Code_Javascript_1k. Thanks Ahmad-A0.\r\n- Removed some non-Swedish words from the Swedish list.\r\n- Added Polish_2k. Thanks jacekdobrowolski.\r\n- Added Malay. Thanks krsntn.\r\n- Added Czech_10k. Thanks Inirdin.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where punctuation and numbers settings would reset after practising missed words. Thanks SeerLite.\r\n- Fixed broken discord integration link.\r\n- Fixed enter affecting the test even when not focused on the words.\r\n- Fixed quick tab not working on the result screen.\r\n- Fixed a bug where media keys would insert text into the test.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Renamed list files for easier project navigation.\r\n- Live accuracy will now update on keypress rather than every second.\r\n- Added more server side data validation.\r\n- Made some errors more descriptive."

Very helpful to keep the progression trend upwards, without pushing yourself for your pb too much. Thanks Jonny-exe!\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where Portuguese tests could not be started.\r\n- Fixed 'swapEscAndTab' sometimes not working as intended. Thanks SeerLite.\r\n- Fixed a graphical bug where the live wpm and accuracy would be visible for a split second when refreshing the page.\r\n- Updated the regular expressions while checking the completed test to avoid issued with tests not saving.\r\n- Fixed a bug where typing some special characters in the command line would result in an error.\r\n- Updated the screenshot library to fix a bug where custom fonts would not be visible. Thanks TayIorRobinson.\r\n- Hopefully fixed a bug where account page could not be loaded due to stats not defaulting to 0. Needs a bit more testing from the users.\r\n- Fixed a bug where code languages with punctuation enabled would not initialise properly.\r\n- Fixed an error when trying to reset config to default.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Twitch Emotes. Thanks MakerJake01.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Backend optimisations.\r\n- You can now use Vi-like bindings in the command line (Alt+J and Alt+K)."

    "body": "Don't be alarmed, this is just a collection of previous updates that didn't get their own release - with so many changes I decided to move to version 1.6. Most of these changes have already been live for quite some time. I was on a little vacation and did not have enough time to sit down and write a proper version update.\r\n\r\nAs usual try clearing cache if you don't see the new update.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to typerqeo for continuous massive help with refactoring the code with modern practises in mind.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Added 'Change custom text' to the command line. With this you can open the custom text popup with the command line, and confirm using ctrl + enter. Thanks decafff.\r\n- Backspace will now be ignored outside input fields and will not act as a 'go back in history' button. This should fix problems where firefox users would end their long tests accidentally.\r\n- Added 'no space' funbox. This one is pretty self-explanatory. \r\n\r\nLayouts:\r\n- Added Alpha layout.\r\n- Added Qwertz.\r\n- Added Bepo. Thanks shinze.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Vietnamese 1k. Thanks sheva370.\r\n- Added Vietnamese 5k. Thanks vuong-buihv.\r\n- Fixed noun capitalisation in English 10k. Thanks saxophone.\r\n- Added Code Python. Thanks Fraserbc.\r\n- Added Code C.

Thanks Vitaman02.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Fixed sub color contrast on the matrix theme. Thanks nullaf.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Added 'Toggle always show words history' to the command line.\r\n- Holding down the Command key stops the input. Fixes issues with key combinations adding input.\r\n- Fixed some config loading and saving issues.\r\n- Fixed caret position inconsistency when hide extra letters is enabled. Thanks someotherotherguy.\r\n- Fixed send verification buttons not working.\r\n- Fixed update email popup not showing up.\r\n- Fixed missing '&' on prog dvorak layout.\r\n- Fixed command line issues where keyboard and mouse selection was not cleared.\r\n- Fixed cpm number not being rounded.\r\n- Fixed line scrolling too early sometimes.\r\n- Fixed numpad keys not working.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Removed key data from the database because it's not used and just taking up space.\r\n- Rounding key spacing and duration stats before storing in the database.\r\n- Slimmed down the chart data to take up less space in the database.\r\n- When start graphs at zero is enabled, the graph will be fitted to the wpm line instead of the raw line.\r\n- Added semicolon to punctuation mode. Thanks RealCyGuy.\r\n- Hiding some command line commands if they are not available to be used.\r\n- Switched the timing method to use 'performance.now()' instead of 'Date.now()' to avoid issues with timezones and changing system time.\r\n- Added artwork to the readme file. Thanks jeremygautama.\r\n- Updated wording on the privacy page. Thanks 18praneeth.\r\n- Word highlight mode will now show extra letters by default. This can still be disabled using the 'hide extra letters' option.\r\n- Major refactoring work. Thanks typerqeo."

    "body": "So, for anyone asking about the ads - looks like google is not happy about 'suspicious traffic' and they are 'looking into it' - which could take a while. This basically means that someone was likely spam clicking ads. I love you guys for wanting to support me, but don't spam the ads (if they ever comeback) because uncle google is watching :|.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Added 'enable ads' to the command line.\r\n- Added quick navigation to the top of the settings page. Thanks corey.\r\n- Added static keymap mode. \r\n- Added 'override sync' keymap layout. This means that the keymap will be synchronized with your currently active layout override. If the layout override is 'default' then the keymap will show qwerty.\r\n- You can now click the spacebar on the keymap to show the command line to quickly change the keymap layout.\r\n- Added 'hide extra letters'. This will completely avoid words jumping lines (due to changing width), but might feel a bit confusing when you press a key and nothing happens.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Hungarian 2.5k.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed blind mode not working with word highlight mode.\r\n- Language will no longer be changed to English when entering quote mode.\r\n- Fixed a bug where infinite tests would say NaN. \r\n- Custom theme (when clicking the custom link) is only applied after the user has logged in, to make sure it is saved properly.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Adjusted the way config is loaded.\r\n- Added missing 'toggle start graphs at zero' to the command line."

I did as much testing as I could, but some users are still reporting issues with it (but weirdly enough, not on firefox) so will continue to answer bug reports and try to get it perfect.\r\n- Execute order 'stop the goddamn words from jumping around'. Until this update, the last word of a line could jump unexpectedly to the next if you make a typo and add some extra letter. This is no longer the case, and any extra input will be ignored. Yay, no more jumping words.\r\n- Added word highlight mode. 10ff fans, this one's for you. Thanks corey.\r\n- Added always show cpm. We like big numbers. Thanks corey.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Fixed the typo in 'Portuguese'. Whoops.\r\n\r\nLayouts:\r\n- Added support for ISO layouts. Thanks stevep99.\r\n- Added Colemak DH ISO.\r\n- Added Colemak DHk ISO.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Magic Girl and Dark Magic Girl. Thanks Mintlodica and Launch.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed caps lock warning not showing if caps was pressed on another page.\r\n- Fixed Hebrew showing up backwards.\r\n- Hey brah! I heard you like practising missed after you practise missed words so we fixed a bug to make it possible to practise missed words after you practise missed words.\r\n- Fixed keymap layout and layout override triggering together from the command line.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Switched some color around to transparent instead of background to support custom background images.\r\n- Smooth caret is now BUTTER smooth.\r\n- When blind mode is enabled the keymap will no longer flash in red when you make a typo.\r\n- English 1k and 10k will show up  above the words to let you know that they are active.\r\n- Made workflow changes when contributing. Added npm dependencies. Thanks typerqeo.\r\n- Slightly reorganized the settings page.\r\n- Showing the keymap layout in the space key."
